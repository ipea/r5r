## Arguments

- r5r_network:

  A routable transport network created with
  [`build_network()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/build_network.md).

- origins:

  Either a `POINT sf` object with WGS84 CRS, or a `data.frame`
  containing the columns `id`, `lon` and `lat`.

- zoom:

  Resolution of the travel time surface used to create isochrones, can
  be between 9 and 12. More detailed isochrones will result from larger
  numbers, at the expense of compute time. Specifically, a raster grid
  of travel times in the Web Mercator projection at this zoom level is
  created, and the isochrones are interpolated from this grid. For more
  information on how the grid cells are defined, see [the R5
  documentation.](https://docs.conveyal.com/analysis/methodology#zoom-levels)

- mode:

  A character vector. The transport modes allowed for access, transfer
  and vehicle legs of the trips. Defaults to `WALK`. See details for
  other options.

- mode_egress:

  A character vector. The transport mode used after egress from the last
  public transport. It can be either `WALK`, `BICYCLE` or `CAR`.
  Defaults to `WALK`. Ignored when public transport is not used.

- departure_datetime:

  A POSIXct object. Only affects public transport legs; when routing
  with public transport, it must fall within the service period of the
  GTFS feeds (`calendar.txt`; see
  [`check_transit_availability()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/check_transit_availability.md)).
  Defaults to [`Sys.time()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.time.html). See
  details for how datetimes are parsed.

- time_window:

  An integer. The time window in minutes for which `r5r` will calculate
  multiple travel time matrices departing each minute (or, with a
  `fare_structure`, at departure times sampled at random within the
  window; see `draws_per_minute`). Defaults to 10 minutes. The function
  returns the result based on median travel times. See
  [`vignette("time_window", package = "r5r")`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/articles/time_window.md).

- percentiles:

  An integer vector (max length of 5, an `R5` limit). The travel time
  percentiles within the time window from which accessibility is
  calculated. They apply to travel times, not to the accessibility
  distribution: with 25, accessibility is calculated from the 25th
  percentile travel time, which may differ from the 25th percentile of
  accessibility. Defaults to 50 (the median travel time). With more than
  one value, the output gets a column identifying the percentile of each
  estimate. See the `R5` documentation at
  <https://docs.conveyal.com/analysis/methodology#accounting-for-variability>.

- max_walk_time:

  An integer. The maximum walking time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network, or to make transfers within the network. Defaults
  to no restrictions, as long as `max_trip_duration` is respected. The
  max time is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if you set
  `max_walk_time` to 15, you could potentially walk up to 15 minutes to
  reach transit, and up to *another* 15 minutes to reach the destination
  after leaving transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit.

- max_bike_time:

  An integer. The maximum cycling time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network. Defaults to no restrictions, as long as
  `max_trip_duration` is respected. The max time is considered
  separately for each leg (e.g. if you set `max_bike_time` to 15
  minutes, you could potentially cycle up to 15 minutes to reach
  transit, and up to *another* 15 minutes to reach the destination after
  leaving transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit.

- max_car_time:

  An integer. The maximum driving time (in minutes) to access and egress
  the transit network, or to complete car-only trips. Defaults to no
  restrictions, as long as `max_trip_duration` is respected. The max
  time is considered separately for each leg (e.g. if you set
  `max_car_time` to 15 minutes, you could potentially drive up to 15
  minutes to reach transit, and up to *another* 15 minutes to reach the
  destination after leaving transit). Defaults to `Inf`, no limit. In
  car-only trips, whenever `max_car_time` differs from
  `max_trip_duration`, the lowest value is considered.

- max_trip_duration:

  An integer. The maximum trip duration in minutes. Defaults to 120
  minutes (2 hours).

- walk_speed:

  A numeric. Average walk speed in km/h. Defaults to 3.6 km/h.

- bike_speed:

  A numeric. Average cycling speed in km/h. Defaults to 12 km/h.

- max_rides:

  An integer. The maximum number of public transport rides allowed in
  the same trip. Defaults to 3.

- max_lts:

  An integer between 1 and 4. The maximum level of traffic stress that
  cyclists will tolerate. A value of 1 means cyclists will only travel
  through the quietest streets, while a value of 4 indicates cyclists
  can travel through any road. Defaults to 2. See details.

- fare_structure:

  A fare structure object, following the convention set in
  [`setup_fare_structure()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/setup_fare_structure.md).
  This object describes how transit fares should be calculated. See
  [`vignette("fare_structure", package = "r5r")`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/articles/fare_structure.md)
  for its structure.

- max_fare:

  A number. The maximum value that trips can cost when calculating the
  fastest journey between each origin and destination pair. Defaults to
  `Inf` (no limit). A finite value requires a `fare_structure`; an error
  is raised otherwise.

- new_carspeeds:

  A `data.frame` specifying the new car speed for each OSM edge id. This
  table must contain columns `osm_id`, `max_speed` and `speed_type`. The
  `"speed_type"` column is of class character and it indicates whether
  the values in `"max_speed"` should be interpreted as percentages of
  original speeds (`"scale"`) or as absolute speeds (`"km/h"`).
  Alternatively, the `new_carspeeds` parameter can receive an
  `sf data.frame` with POLYGON geometry that indicates the new car speed
  for all the roads that fall within each polygon. In this case, the
  table must contain the columns `poly_id` with a unique id for each
  polygon, `scale` with the new speed scaling factors and `priority`,
  which is a number ranking which polygon should be considered in case
  of overlapping polygons. See more info in the scenarios vignette
  ([`vignette("scenarios", package = "r5r")`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/articles/scenarios.md)).

- carspeed_scale:

  Numeric. The scaling factor applied to the car speed of road segments
  not specified in `new_carspeeds`. Defaults to `1`, which keeps the
  speeds of the unlisted roads unchanged.

- new_lts:

  A `data.frame` specifying the new LTS levels for each OSM edge id. The
  table must contain columns `osm_id` and `lts`. Alternatively, the
  `new_lts` parameter can receive an `sf data.frame` with LINESTRING
  geometry. R5 will then find the nearest road for each LINESTRING and
  update its LTS value accordingly.

- draws_per_minute:

  An integer. The number of Monte Carlo draws to perform per minute of
  `time_window`. Defaults to 5. This would mean 300 draws in a 60-minute
  time window, for example. With the default routing algorithm, this
  parameter only affects the results when the GTFS feeds contain a
  `frequencies.txt` table; otherwise, r5r still routes a departure every
  minute of `time_window`, in a deterministic way. In functions that
  accept a `fare_structure`, passing one switches to the McRaptor
  algorithm, which instead routes `time_window * draws_per_minute`
  departure times sampled at random within the window (different for
  each origin, and the same in every call from the same origin with the
  same `seed`). This parameter then affects the results with or without
  frequencies. R5's McRaptor cannot sample many departure times per
  minute over long windows, so such combinations raise an error (e.g. 8
  draws per minute in a 10-minute window, or 5 in a window of 150
  minutes or more), as does a total of exactly 200 draws.

- seed:

  An integer or `NULL`. The seed of the Monte Carlo draws of the
  departure offsets of frequency-based transit routes and, with the
  McRaptor algorithm, of the departure times sampled within
  `time_window`. Defaults to `NULL`, in which case the draws are random
  and results may vary slightly between runs. With an integer, the same
  inputs always give the same results, regardless of `n_threads`.
  Results are still a Monte Carlo sample, so a different seed may give
  slightly different results: report the seed used and check how
  sensitive the results are to it. Note that
  [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) has no effect on
  these draws. With the default routing algorithm, this parameter only
  affects the results when the GTFS feeds contain a `frequencies.txt`
  table. In functions that accept a `fare_structure`, passing one
  switches to the McRaptor algorithm, and `seed` then affects the
  results with or without frequencies.

- n_threads:

  An integer. The number of threads to use when running the router in
  parallel. Defaults to use all available threads (`Inf`).

- verbose:

  A logical. Whether to show `R5` informative messages when running the
  function. Defaults to `FALSE` (`R5` error messages are still shown).
  `TRUE` shows detailed output, useful for debugging issues not caught
  by `r5r`.

- progress:

  A logical. Whether to show a progress counter when running the router.
  Defaults to `TRUE`. Only works when `verbose` is set to `FALSE`, so
  the progress counter does not interfere with `R5`'s output messages.
  Setting `progress` to `TRUE` may impose a small penalty for
  computation efficiency, because the progress counter must be
  synchronized among all active threads.

## Value

A `"sf" "data.frame"` for each isochrone of each origin.

## Transport modes

`R5` allows for multiple combinations of transport modes. The options
include:

- **Transit modes:** `TRAM`, `SUBWAY`, `RAIL`, `BUS`, `FERRY`,
  `CABLE_CAR`, `GONDOLA`, `FUNICULAR`. The option `TRANSIT`
  automatically considers all public transport modes available.

- **Non transit modes:** `WALK`, `BICYCLE`, `CAR`.

## Level of Traffic Stress (LTS)

When cycling is enabled in `R5` (by passing the value `BICYCLE` to
either `mode` or `mode_egress`), setting `max_lts` will allow cycling
only on streets with a given level of danger/stress. Setting `max_lts`
to 1, for example, will allow cycling only on separated bicycle
infrastructure or low-traffic streets and routing will revert to walking
when traversing any links with LTS exceeding 1. Setting `max_lts` to 3
will allow cycling on links with LTS 1, 2 or 3. Routing also reverts to
walking if the street segment is tagged as non-bikable in OSM (e.g. a
staircase), independently of the specified max LTS.

The default methodology for assigning LTS values to network edges is
based on commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. See more info about LTS
in the original documentation of R5 from Conveyal at
<https://docs.conveyal.com/learn-more/traffic-stress>. In summary:

- **LTS 1**: Tolerable for children. This includes low-speed, low-volume
  streets, as well as those with separated bicycle facilities (such as
  parking-protected lanes or cycle tracks).

- **LTS 2**: Tolerable for the mainstream adult population. This
  includes streets where cyclists have dedicated lanes and only have to
  interact with traffic at formal crossing.

- **LTS 3**: Tolerable for "enthused and confident" cyclists. This
  includes streets which may involve close proximity to moderate- or
  high-speed vehicular traffic.

- **LTS 4**: Tolerable only for "strong and fearless" cyclists. This
  includes streets where cyclists are required to mix with moderate- to
  high-speed vehicular traffic.

For advanced users, you can provide custom LTS values by adding a tag
`<key = "lts">` to the `osm.pbf` file.

## Datetime parsing

`r5r` ignores the timezone attribute of datetime objects when parsing
dates and times, using the study area's timezone instead. For example,
let's say you are running some calculations using Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, as your study area. The datetime
`as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")` will
be parsed as May 13th, 2019, 14:00h in Rio's local time, as expected.
But
`as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00", format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S", tz = "Europe/Paris")`
will also be parsed as the exact same date and time in Rio's local time,
perhaps surprisingly, ignoring the timezone attribute.

## Routing algorithm

The
[`travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/travel_time_matrix.md),
[`expanded_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/expanded_travel_time_matrix.md),
[`arrival_travel_time_matrix()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/arrival_travel_time_matrix.md)
and
[`accessibility()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/accessibility.md)
functions use an `R5`-specific extension to the RAPTOR routing algorithm
(see Conway et al., 2017). This RAPTOR extension uses a systematic
sample of one departure per minute over the time window set by the user
in the 'time_window' parameter. A detailed description of base RAPTOR
can be found in Delling et al (2015). However, whenever the user
includes transit fares inputs to these functions, they automatically
switch to use an `R5`-specific extension to the McRAPTOR routing
algorithm.
[`detailed_itineraries()`](https://ipea.github.io/r5r/dev/reference/detailed_itineraries.md)
also uses RAPTOR when it only returns the fastest itinerary
(`shortest_path = TRUE`) and no fares are used.
